# Snake game
 I took the challenge that coding a Snake game in 1 hour using Javascript after my friend told me that his friend can do it. Of course, I have never done it before and I am not a developer who programs games.  My mindset is very simple, just think about how to draw the snake make it run, and eat the food...
 
The game hasn't finished yet, still has bugs because I only did it for around 1 hour. Let's see what I had done
